A simple program written in Visual Basic.NET to keep an integer score. The score can be updated by adding or subtracting 1, or set manually.

Score is written to score.txt in the working directory. This file is intended to be added as a Text Source in OBS.

## Development
To keep the executable size to a minimum, the earliest .NET Framework version is targeted, which is .NET Framework 2.0 in Visual Studio 2019. Later versions of Visual Studio may have issues opening this solution if .NET Framework 2.0 is not available as a target.
