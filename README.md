A simple program written in Visual Basic.NET to keep integer scores. The score can be updated by adding or subtracting 1, or set manually. Two additional buttons move 1 point from one score to another.

Score is written to score1.txt and score2.txt in the working directory. These files are intended to be added as Text Sources in OBS.

## Development
To keep the executable size to a minimum, the earliest .NET Framework version is targeted, which is .NET Framework 2.0 in Visual Studio 2019. Later versions of Visual Studio may have issues opening this solution if .NET Framework 2.0 is not available as a target.
